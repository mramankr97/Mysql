Nested Query
============

Problem 1 : The following query is given:

SELECT
  department_id
FROM
  employee
WHERE
  salary > 10000;

The query returns values for department_id for which salary is greater than 10000. Using the result of this query as a subquery, display the names of all 
departments for which the above condition is met.

=> SELECT department_name from department WHERE department_id IN(SELECT department_id FROM employee WHERE salary>10000);

=====================================================================================================================================================================

Problem 2 : Please follow the steps below.

1. Create a query that returns the values for the job_id from the employee table 
where the salary is greater than 10,000.

=> SELECT job_id from employee WHERE salary>10000;

2. Using the result of the previous query as a subquery, display the names of all positions for which the above condition is met.

=> SELECT job_title from job where job_id IN (SELECT job_id from employee WHERE salary>10000);

=====================================================================================================================================================================

Problem 3 : The following query is given:

SELECT product_id,COUNT(*) AS number_of_orders FROM sale GROUP BY product_id;

Modify this query to display only the first three values for the product_id 
with the highest value for the number_of_orders column.

=> SELECT product_id,COUNT(*) AS number_of_orders
FROM sale GROUP BY product_id ORDER by COUNT(product_id) DESC LIMIT 3;
