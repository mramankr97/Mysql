GROUP BY and HAVING clasuses
============================


Problem 1 : Group data at the Sector level. Then find the average EPS for each sector and assign the alias AvgEPSPerSector. 
Display sectors with AvgEPSPerSector above 10 and sort the result by the AvgEPSPerSector column in descending order.

=>  select sector,AVG(eps) as AvgEPSPerSector 
    from Stock 
    GROUP by sector 
    HAVING AvgEPSPerSector>10 
    ORDER by AvgEPSPerSector DESC;
    
    
========================================================================================================================================================================

Problem 2 : The following query is given:

SELECT job_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employee GROUP BY job_id ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;

Modify this query to display those job_id values for which the average salary is greater than 10,000.

=> SELECT
  job_id,
  AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM
  employee
GROUP BY
  job_id
  HAVING avg_salary>10000
ORDER BY
  avg_salary DESC;
