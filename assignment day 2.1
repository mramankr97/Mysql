GROUP BY and HAVING clasuses
============================


Problem 1 : Group data at the Sector level. Then find the average EPS for each sector and assign the alias AvgEPSPerSector. 
Display sectors with AvgEPSPerSector above 10 and sort the result by the AvgEPSPerSector column in descending order.

=>  select sector,AVG(eps) as AvgEPSPerSector 
    from Stock 
    GROUP by sector 
    HAVING AvgEPSPerSector>10 
    ORDER by AvgEPSPerSector DESC;
